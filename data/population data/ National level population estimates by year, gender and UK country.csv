This dataset provides population estimates for the local authorities in Wales, the English regions and the UK countries for the period from 1991 onwards by gender and single year of age, together with some aggregated age groups. Data are produced and reported annually and relate to the 30 June of each year and the data presented here reflect changes made to population estimates from 2001 to 2010 in re-basing the data to be consistent with the results of the 2011 Census.

More information on the methodology used to produce these estimates can be found at: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/quality-information/population/index.html.

Data are provided on an unrounded basis although the Office for National Statistics advise that any results presented from these data are rounded to the nearest 100 where practical.
