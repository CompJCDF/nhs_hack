Footnotes:
"1","Data for deaths and discharges, average length of stay, turnover interval and bed use factor is not published for 2012-13. More information is provided in the notes section below."
"2","Data for deaths and discharges, average length of stay, turnover interval and bed use factor is not published for 2013-14. More information is provided in the notes section below."
"3","Average daily number of staffed beds in which inpatients are being or could be treated without any change in facilities or staff being made. On some occasions, 'average daily occupied beds' may exceed 'average daily available beds'. In these instances the 'percentage occupancy' has been set to 100%."
"4","Average daily number of beds occupied by inpatients under the care of a consultant in a particular specialty. On some occasions, 'average daily occupied beds' may exceed 'average daily available beds'. This can be due to both patient management as well as recording methods. In these instances the 'percentage occupancy' has been set to 100%."
"5","All inpatients who have gone through the full admission procedure as an emergency or those admitted electively with the intention of staying in hospital at least one night and who have subsequently been discharged (or transferred to another hospital) or have died in hospital. Infants born in a maternity department, healthy persons accompanying inpatients and sick staff treated in their own quarters are not included. Data for this field is not published from 2012-13. More detail is provided in the notes section below."
"6","Percentage of time that beds are occupied. Calculated by multiplying 'average daily occupied beds' by 100 and dividing by 'average daily available beds'. On some occasions, 'average daily occupied beds' may exceed 'average daily available beds'. In these instances the 'percentage occupancy' has been set to 100%. Care should be taken when using these figures if the corresponding 'average daily available beds' is small, because this may result in a large value due to the calculation performed."
"7","The length of time, on average, each inpatient physically occupied a bed (in days).  Calculated by multiplying 'average daily occupied beds' by 365 and dividing by 'inpatient cases'. Care should be taken when using these figures if the corresponding 'inpatient cases' is small, because this may result in a large value due to the calculation performed. Data for this field is not published from 2012-13. More detail is provided in the notes section below."
"8","The average length of time, in days, that the bed is empty between each patient.  Calculated multiplying 'average daily unoccupied beds' by 365 and dividing by 'inpatient cases'. On some occasions, 'average daily occupied beds' may exceed 'average daily available beds', leading to a negative value for 'turnover interval'. Care should be taken when using these figures if the corresponding 'inpatient cases' is small, because this may result in a large value due to the calculation performed. Data for this field is not published from 2012-13. More detail is provided in the notes section below."
"9","Average number of patients using each bed during the period under review.  Calculated by dividing 'inpatient cases' by 'average daily available beds. Care should be taken when using these figures if the corresponding 'average daily available beds' is small, because this may result in a large value due to the calculation performed. Data for this field is not published from 2012-13. More detail is provided in the notes section below."
"Specialty","Each bed and patient attendance is classified by specialty. In previous years, specialties were aggregated to speciality groups in the StatsWales table. However user feedback has indicated that these specialty groups were little used, and therefore data are no longer presented by specialty groups, and a new StatsWales table has been created to reflect this. However the individual specialties themselves can be aggregated if needed to align with those speciality groups presented in the NHS Wales Data Dictionary. "

This presents summary information, provided by the NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS), on bed use in Wales. Due to data quality issues, a decision has been made not to publish the derived beds fields (average length of stay, turnover interval and bed use factor) from 2012-13 onwards, until a wider review of bed data has been concluded and subsequently, the data quality issues are resolved. Further information on this is provided in the Key Quality Information section of the release. Due to the data quality issues, users are advised to use caution when making data comparisons, particularly at LHB level.
